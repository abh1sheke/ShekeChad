## Why I have dropped NvChad
NvChad is a great starting point for beginners and developers who aren't accustomed to spending hours on perfecting their editor setup. However, it is quite bloated with all its pre-installed plugins and features.

In my experience, I have never found myself to use more than 30% of the plugins provided at startup. All this fluff really made my editor setup extremely bloated even though these plugins were lazy loaded.

In conclusion, I wanted a simpler setup and experience with my editor and NvChad just didn't satisfy my needs.
